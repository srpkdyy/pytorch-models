# VGG
## Overview
This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of the following paper:

> **Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition** <br>
> Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman <br>
> https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556

## TODO
- [ ] Add RGB color shift for augmentation.
- [ ] Multi-scale training.
- [ ] init weights with a trained A model.

## Usage
Following command train the model
```bash
python train.py
```

Confirm that the number of parameters are same as the paper.

```bash
python vgg.py
```
